As we work as a team, so we should follow some guidelines to meet the code standards and make readable and maintainable.

## Setup Process
_will be updated soon!_

### Tips
- You MUST create your branch from the issue page.
- We will follow **Git Flow**.
- Based on Git Flow, so every issue should be in separate **pull request**
- Commit MUST be like that [module] then describe your work for example: [product] filter products based on date.
- Commit MUST focus on one feature at once, please don't work on many aspects in one commits.
- Make sure your pull request has passed the pipelines
